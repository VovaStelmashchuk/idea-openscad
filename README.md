# OpenSCAD Language Support for IntelliJ Platform

This is a plugin for the products based on IntelliJ Platform (Idea, PyCharm, etc.) providing (for the moment) syntax highlighting and code folding support for the OpenSCAD language.

A color scheme coming close to what the built-in OpenSCAD editor uses is also provided and can be selected in the preferences using the navigation path: Editor/Color Scheme/Scheme/OpenSCAD.Default.

The plugin is in it's early development phase, things are not stable yet, but already quite usable !

It is planned to implement all of the features the IntelliJ Platform provides support for:
* structure views;
* code completion;
* refactorings;
* intention actions;
* code navigation;
* library support;
* run configurations (start external OpenSCAD);
* etc.
